This is a model of the axon consisting of microtubules with dynein/tau crosslinks surrounded by an actin cortex with myosin crosslinks. The cortex and microtubules are connected by dynein crosslinks. In addition, the model contains a growth cone node is is connected to the actin ring by MPC, and has interaction with the microtubules as described in the MECH_MT02.pyx mechanism.

Although this model contains relatively much physics, the individual parameters for this particular model are are not intended to be physically accurate, but rather to demonstrate concepts.
